            <p>
                [Sidhi capital] is not a bank, has no central account, does not collect your MONEY; 
                [Sidhi capital] is not an online business, an investment or a sales program. It is 
                neither a company, nor an enterprise. There is no boss, no owner, no 
                office space, no formal organization, no legal entity, no business, no 
                investment or no other activities of any form. [COmpany Name] is a community where 
                people help each other. Here, people provide help free of charge, and are 
                absolutely conscious to remit to each other directly, from one account to 
                another, for direct currency exchange; all funds are circulated among 
                participants; no intermediary or intermediate link can touch the money. 
                Only millions of common participants remit for providing help through 
                personal account. Only with good will, one person provides help to another 
                person in need of help, absolutely free of charge. Today you help others, 
                and tomorrow others will help you. Just no more!
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Example of Providing Help</h2>
            <p>
                If you want to provide the help of $100 to another community member in need, 
                there are two big buttons on the home page: “Provide help” and “Get help”, 
                and please click “Provide help” to input the help amount to generate an order. 
                [COmpany Name] system would match a community participant in need of help; you transfer to 
                the participant by paying the help amount. Just in this way, you can finish the 
                whole process of providing help. In your personal office account, you will get 
                the reward of 100 Mavro-USD and the reward would grow immediately! Your Mavro 
                will grow at 1% per day, up to 30% monthly; just in a month, the initial 100 
                Mavro-USD will grow into 130 Mavro-USD. However, this does not need to wait a 
                month; help can be requested at any time; just by clicking “Get help” on the 
                home page of [COmpany Name] system, you would get financial assistance from other 
                participants in the world. Just like you did, they transfer the money to you; 
                just in this way, you turn your Mavro of [COmpany Name] system into the fund needed for 
                your daily life. The operation is simple and you will be clear just after one 
                use. This model allows each participant to cast off the slaved money-making life!

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Welcome Bonus 99 TRX</h2>
            <p>
                All new participants of the [COmpany Name]GI system are provided with a welcome bonus of 
                99 TRX. You can only get it if you become an active participant in the system; 
                to do this, you need to create any deposit of at least 100 TRX and wait for it 
                to be confirmed in your Mavro section. The welcome bonus is given only once, 
                after registering a new account, and only for one IP address.
            </p>
            <p>
                As soon as the request to create a deposit is confirmed by confirming all orders 
                and the recipient of the payment confirms receipt of funds, the welcome bonus will 
                be confirmed immediately, however it will be frozen for 2 weeks and you will be 
                able to withdraw it only after 14 days from the moment the last order was confirmed 
                in your request to create a deposit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freezing the welcome bonus for 2 weeks is necessary to prevent users from abusing 
                the creation of multi-accounts from different IP addresses just for the purpose of 
                stealing these bonuses. And there have been cases before when participants created 
                an account, deposited 100 TRX, and then immediately, the next day, withdrew 200 TRX 
                and robbed the system in this way. You understand perfectly well that this should 
                not happen. Therefore, you will have to wait 2 weeks to receive the welcome bonus.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Registration Bonus 5%</h2>
            <p>
                All new participants who provide help for the first time (create a deposit) have the 
                opportunity to take advantage of the registration bonus by checking the appropriate 
                box in the deposit creation wizard. The registration bonus is 5% of the amount of 
                your first investment and is given only once per new account. The registration bonus 
                is frozen for 2 weeks and will be available for withdrawal only after 14 days. And at 
                the same time, the main capital of your deposit is frozen for 2 weeks if you have chosen 
                the Simple Investment Plan.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Referral Bonus 7%</h2>
            <p>
                You get reward 7% from deposits of the participant you invited. Inviting new members 
                into the Community is your additional contribution to its development. But nobody 
                forces the members of the Community to invite new participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                But at the same time, understanding that [COmpany Name] network can’t exist without development 
                and participants’ encouragement in the form of referral bonuses motivate many people 
                to take an active position.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Guider’s Bonus 5%</h2>

                Guiders of [COmpany Name] Global Community can create their own structures and get a bonus from

                10 active PH. The Guider status is automatically assigned by the system after you 
                have 10 or more active members in your team, or the Administrator or CRO employee 
                can assign the Guider status to you. An active participant is a participant who has 
                paid for at least one order.
            </p>
            <p>
                Guider’s bonuses are credited in the same way as referral, but only from new money 
                deposited and will be available to withdraw after confirmation of your help provided.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Guider's Title</h2>
            <p>
                If the participant has invited 10 or more direct downlines with active PH, the title 
                of the Guider will be assigned. Guider’s bonuses are available for withdrawal as soon 
                as a deposit of your active downlines is confirmed. Please also note that it is a 
                seasonal bonus, which is not given for a long time, only for a short period of time.

            <p>
                Retiree bonuses are given to participants for their long-standing and active involvement

                retirees receive additional financial incentives depending on their contribution and 
                activity in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The calculation of retiree bonuses is done by the administration and is based on 
                various factors, including the total amount of PH provided, the number of active 
                participants invited, and the overall contributions to the growth of the [COmpany Name] network. 
                The retiree bonuses are paid monthly and serve as a recognition of the valuable 
                contributions made by long-term members of the community.
