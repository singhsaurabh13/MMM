        <p className='px-28'>The contemporary world is evil. It is heartless, imbalanced and unreasonable.
             It truly is a world ruled by money. It is not for the everyday people. It is for individuals who generate this money, for the banking institutions and investors, governments and business tycoons.
              And as a consequence, the unsuspecting members of the public are simply "chips" in this game. They pretty much work as attendants to the major players.
              Some important questions you need to ask yourself… How come bankers work far less but get paid a hundred times higher? Precisely what is the backbone of social welfare? Workers. 
              However, why is it that bankers live a quality of life that is 100 times better than the one lived by the masses who genuinely do a lot of work? Do the bankers work harder? Certainly, they do not! Moreover they never even create any sort of material value, compared to the workers. 
              Why then is the disparity in earnings extremely huge?</p>
              <br />
              <p className='px-28 mb-10'>I know a lot of you are wondering as you read this, thinking to yourselves:
                 "Well…how can you compare a banker and a worker? The banker heads the bank, knows all the powerful people, and has control over money. We, the ordinary people, have no money, no clout, and no power. It’s only natural that the banker should live a better life than we do.
                 <br />
                 However, I need to let you know that none of this is "natural". Things are only this way because we got used to the status quo. People think to themselves that this is the way they met the world, and this is how it was meant to be. In reality, this is far from the truth, and things can be different!!! I know a pertinent question still remains; why is it that the banker works less, but lives better? Better than the ordinary workers; the miner, woodcutter, oil rigger, or even the factory worker? The reason is simple; the banker always has money. Yes, MONEY! The all-important foundation stone.
                  Maybe we should dig deeper into the world of money.
                  <br />
                  Money is meant to be the measure of labour, so how come those who do the hardest labour get the lowest pay? How come the world is unfair? We’ve always been told from the cradle that the only way to make money and be successful is work, work, and more work. 
                  That we should work hard, and earn money honestly.It sounds ridiculous, really. But what do the billionaires who earned all the billions honestly, and the hard way, have to say about that? It would be interesting to know what they think.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <p>What should we expect for all the work we do? In fact, what do we get at the end of it all? Low wages, small pensions, no rest, and a constant and continuous battle with debts. You’ve lived all your life working for billionaires, building another man’s dreams, you’ve been stripped of all your health, power, and energy, 
                    squeezed like a lemon and thrown into a dustbin once you are past your usefulness.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>That, unfortunately, is the way of this modern, contemporary world. The terrible reality of our society
                        . This is the way it ends up for a large majority of people. It ended up in much the same way for their fathers and mothers before them, then their grandmothers a
                        nd grandfathers…and if things stay the way they are, it will be the same for their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren…and their own children…and the cycle goes on and on. This is wrong, and so unfair! I hear you say. Some people have everything. They walk in golden slippers, they fly in private jets, while other people can hardly make ends meet, or feed their families, even though the rich and the poor “work honestly”, and we are all supposed to be equal. So, why does it have to be this way?! The answer is simple;
                         we’ve been told a lie, over and over again. A lie that is huge, continuous, and exaggerated. Well-groomed and well-fed masters of life go on TV every day to tell you these lies. Do not believe them.</p>
                         <br />
                         <p>Believe me when I tell you this; money is not a measure of labour, and people are not equal either. These are the lies we’ve been fed with for far too long. Yet some people decide to trust in the lies, living in an unjust and unfair world. Do you know the reason why they cheat you? So that they can easily control you. Let me show you why everyone is not equal.</p>
                         <p>Just imagine you are a billionaire or a member of parliament. Then think about the things a billionaire would do; eats differently, lives differently, relaxes in a different way, he spends in a day what you’d spend in a whole year, he goes to a Swiss hospital, his children go to the best and most expensive schools…I can go on and on. Think about this, then tell me if you see any "equality".</p>
